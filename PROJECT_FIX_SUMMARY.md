# Fleet Management System - Project Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-07-20
## Status: Major Issues Resolved

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve critical data display and integration issues in the Fleet Management System.

## Initial Issues Reported
1. "maintenance logs not getting pulled for vehicles"
2. "fuel records not seen"
3. "no ecse student records seen"
4. Navigation issues
5. Database column naming problems

## Root Cause Analysis
The system had database structure issues:
- 30 tables total, 17 empty (57%)
- Multiple overlapping vehicle tables
- Generic column names (unnamed_0 through unnamed_13)
- Inconsistent foreign keys
- Data not properly integrated with website

## Major Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Consolidation (Completed)
- **Before**: 3 vehicle tables (buses, vehicles, fleet_vehicles) with inconsistent data
- **After**: Unified approach using buses (10 records) and vehicles (44 records) tables
- **Total**: 54 vehicles now properly loaded

### 2. ECSE Student Management (Fixed)
- Added missing Address field to ECSEStudent model
- Fixed nullable field handling
- Added ECSE dashboard link to manager dashboard
- 825 ECSE students now accessible

### 3. Maintenance Records (Fixed)
- Consolidated 4 maintenance tables into 1 (maintenance_records)
- Fixed foreign key references (bus_id → vehicle_id)
- 458 maintenance records now properly linked

### 4. Fleet Page Error (Fixed)
- Issue: "Unable to load fleet data" error
- Cause: Code trying to query fleet_vehicles table with wrong schema
- Fix: Updated loadAllFleetVehiclesFromDB() to load from buses and vehicles tables
- Also fixed loadConsolidatedVehiclesFromDB(), loadConsolidatedBusesFromDB(), and loadConsolidatedNonBusVehiclesFromDB()

### 5. Dashboard Improvements (Fixed)
- Fixed driver count to filter by role='driver'
- Added real activity tracking
- Fixed ECSE upcoming assessments calculation
- Fixed active drivers count
- Added student count aggregations per route

### 6. Import System (Fixed)
- Implemented importAnalyzeHandler for Excel file analysis
- Implemented importValidateHandler for data validation
- Implemented importExecuteHandler for actual imports
- Added proper error handling and validation

### 7. Data Validation (Fixed)
- Added mileage validation (ending > beginning)
- Fixed cost calculations to prevent division by zero
- Added proper null handling for all database fields

## Technical Changes

### Updated Files
1. **models.go**
   - Updated ECSEStudent with nullable fields and Address
   - Added helper methods for nullable field handling

2. **data.go**
   - Rewrote loadAllFleetVehiclesFromDB() to use buses/vehicles tables
   - Fixed all consolidated vehicle loading functions
   - Added proper type conversions for nullable fields

3. **handlers.go**
   - Updated fleet handler with fallback logic
   - Fixed manager dashboard real data integration
   - Added proper error handling

4. **handlers_missing.go**
   - Implemented all missing import handlers
   - Added file upload and validation logic

5. **database.go**
   - Updated queries to use correct table names
   - Fixed maintenance record queries

6. **Templates**
   - Updated manager_dashboard.html with ECSE link
   - Fixed fleet_modern.html to display all vehicles

## Current System Status

### Working Features
- ✅ Login/Authentication (admin/admin)
- ✅ Manager Dashboard with real data
