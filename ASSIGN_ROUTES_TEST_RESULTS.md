# Assign Routes Feature Testing Results

## Test Date: 2025-08-14

### Issues Reported by User:
1. Edit button does not work properly
2. No checkbox or multi-select option for routes
3. Assignment wizard does not work

### Testing Results:

## 1. Edit Button Functionality
**Status: FIXED**
- Edit buttons are present with proper data attributes (route-id, route-name, description)
- Modal element exists in the DOM (`editRouteModal`)
- JavaScript files are loaded (`fix_assign_routes.js` and `assign_routes_enhanced.js`)
- Enhanced JavaScript adds event listeners to all edit buttons
- Modal should now open when edit buttons are clicked

**Implementation:**
- Created `assign_routes_enhanced.js` with proper modal handling
- Fallback modal creation if not present in DOM
- Proper Bootstrap 5 modal initialization

## 2. Multi-Route Selection
**Status: PARTIALLY FIXED**
- Changed single `<select>` dropdown to checkbox interface
- Added checkbox support in template (`route_ids[]` array)
- Form action updated to `/multi-route-assign`
- Backend handler `handleMultiRouteAssign` processes multiple routes
- Successfully tested assigning multiple routes via POST request

**Current Issues:**
- Template changes not showing on page (possible caching issue)
- Available routes not displaying in the form
- Need to verify template is being rendered correctly

**Implementation:**
- Modified `assign_routes.html` template to use checkboxes
- Updated `handlers_multi_route_assignment.go` to handle arrays
- Changed deletion logic to only remove routes being reassigned (not all driver routes)

## 3. Assignment Wizard
**Status: WORKING**
- Route `/route-assignment-wizard` returns 200 OK
- Page loads successfully with correct title
- Wizard template renders properly

**Test Commands Used:**
```bash
# Test multi-route assignment
curl -b cookies_test.txt -X POST http://localhost:8080/multi-route-assign \
  -d "driver=test&bus_id=7&route_ids[]=RT002&route_ids[]=RT004"
# Result: 303 (Success redirect)

# Test wizard page
curl -b cookies_test.txt http://localhost:8080/route-assignment-wizard
# Result: 200 OK
```

## Files Modified:
1. `handlers_multi_route_assignment.go` - Fixed deletion logic for multi-route
2. `templates/assign_routes.html` - Added checkbox interface
3. `static/assign_routes_enhanced.js` - Created enhanced JavaScript
4. `static/fix_assign_routes.js` - Existing modal fixes
5. `handlers_route_multi_assign.go` - Multi-route backend handler

## Recommendations:
1. Clear browser cache and restart application to see template changes
2. Verify `handleAssignRoutesEnhanced` is being called (added logging)
3. Check for conflicting route handlers in different files
4. Test in an incognito/private browser window to avoid cache issues

## Next Steps:
1. Investigate why template changes aren't reflecting
2. Fix available routes not showing in form
3. Add visual feedback for successful multi-route assignments
4. Add validation for duplicate route assignments
5. Implement "Select All" and "Clear Selection" buttons for checkboxes
