# Fleet Management System - Full Project Fix Plan

## Current Status
- Application runs on port 5003
- Fleet page shows error: "Unable to load fleet data"
- Need to systematically fix all issues

## Step 1: Database Connection Check
First, let's verify the database is properly connected and has the right structure.

## Step 2: Fix Fleet Page
The fleet page is trying to load from a non-existent table. We need to:
1. Check what tables actually exist
2. Update queries to use existing tables
3. Test the page loads correctly

## Step 3: Verify All Pages Work
Go through each page systematically:
- Login âœ“
- Manager Dashboard
- Fleet Management
- ECSE Dashboard
- Route Assignments
- Student Management
- Import System
- Reports

## Step 4: Fix Any Remaining Issues
Address any errors found during testing.
