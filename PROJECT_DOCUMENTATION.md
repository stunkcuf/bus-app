## üßπ Cleanup Recommendations

### Files to Delete (Redundant Summaries)
The following files can be safely deleted as their content is consolidated here:
- All `*_SUMMARY.md` files (except this documentation)
- All `*_STATUS.md` files
- All `*_REPORT.md` files
- All temporary planning files

### Files to Keep
- Core documentation (README, CLAUDE, TASKS, PRD)
