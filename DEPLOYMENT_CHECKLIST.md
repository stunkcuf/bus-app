## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Set environment variables
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
export PORT="5000"
export APP_ENV="production"
```

### 2. Build Application
```bash
# Clean build
go mod download
go build -ldflags='-s -w' -o fleet-management .
```

### 3. Database Migration
```bash
# Run migrations (automatic on startup)
./fleet-management
```

### 4. Initial Admin Setup
- Default admin credentials: admin/admin
- **IMPORTANT**: Change admin password immediately after deployment

### 5. Railway Deployment
```bash
# Railway will automatically:
# 1. Detect Go application
# 2. Run build command
# 3. Start application
# 4. Configure health checks
```

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate (Day 1)
- [ ] Change admin password
- [ ] Create production user accounts
- [ ] Import initial fleet data
- [ ] Configure backup schedule
- [ ] Monitor application logs

### Week 1
- [ ] User training sessions
- [ ] Collect initial feedback
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Security scan
- [ ] Update documentation

### Month 1
- [ ] Usage analytics review
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Feature requests evaluation
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Disaster recovery test

## Monitoring Setup

### Application Health
- Endpoint: `/health`
- Expected response: 200 OK
- Check frequency: Every 30 seconds

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. Response time (target: <200ms)
2. Error rate (target: <1%)
3. Active sessions
4. Database connection pool
5. Memory usage

### Alert Thresholds
- Response time > 500ms
- Error rate > 5%
- Database connections > 20
- Memory usage > 80%

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur
1. Keep previous version binary
2. Database backup before deployment
3. Quick rollback procedure:
   ```bash
   # Stop current version
   # Restore previous binary
   # Restart application
   # Verify functionality
   ```

## Support Documentation

### User Guides
- Manager Guide: Managing users, fleet, and routes
