# Bus Fleet Management System v2.0

A secure web-based fleet management system for managing bus routes, drivers, students, and maintenance records. Built with Go and PostgreSQL.

üìö **For complete documentation, see [PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md](PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md)**

## üîí Security Updates (v2.0)

This version includes significant security improvements:
- **Password Hashing**: All passwords are now stored using bcrypt hashing
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms include CSRF token validation
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **Secure Sessions**: Session management with secure cookies
- **Rate Limiting**: Login attempts are rate-limited to prevent brute force attacks

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23.0 or higher
- PostgreSQL database (Railway or similar)
- Environment variables configured

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Database connection (Railway provides DATABASE_URL)
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname?sslmode=require

# Or individual PostgreSQL variables
PGHOST=your-db-host
PGPORT=your-db-port
PGUSER=your-db-user
PGPASSWORD=your-db-password
PGDATABASE=your-db-name

# Application port (optional, defaults to 5000)
PORT=5000
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd bus-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod download
```

3. **IMPORTANT**: Migrate existing passwords to bcrypt hashes:
```bash
go run migrate_passwords.go
```

This will:
- Convert all plain text passwords to secure bcrypt hashes
- Create a temporary admin account if needed (username: `temp_admin`, password: `TempAdmin123!`)

4. Run the application:
```bash
go run .
```

## üîê Default Login

If you're starting fresh or after migration:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `adminpass` (will be hashed on first run)

Or if migration created a temporary admin:
- **Username**: `temp_admin`
- **Password**: `TempAdmin123!`

**Important**: Change these default passwords immediately after first login!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Database Schema
The system uses PostgreSQL with the following main tables:
- `users` - System users (drivers and managers)
- `buses` - Bus fleet information
- `routes` - Route definitions

- `driver_logs` - Daily trip logs
- `bus_maintenance_logs` - Maintenance records
- `vehicles` - Company vehicle inventory
- `activities` - Special trips/activities

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go 1.23.0
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5.3.0, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Security**: bcrypt, CSRF tokens, secure sessions
- **Deployment**: Railway (recommended)

## üö¶ API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /` - Login page
- `POST /` - Login submission
- `GET /health` - Health check

### Protected Endpoints (Require Authentication)
- `GET/POST /new-user` - Create new user (managers only)
- `GET/POST /edit-user` - Edit user (managers only)
- `GET /dashboard` - Auto-routes to appropriate dashboard
- `GET /manager-dashboard` - Manager dashboard
- `GET /driver-dashboard` - Driver dashboard
- `POST /save-log` - Save driver log
- `GET /students` - Student management (drivers)
- `POST /add-student` - Add new student
- `POST /edit-student` - Edit student

- And many more...

## üîß Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Monitor logs** for any security issues or errors
2. **Review user accounts** periodically
3. **Update passwords** regularly
4. **Backup database** regularly
5. **Check for Go security updates**

### Troubleshooting

#### "Invalid credentials" error after migration
Run the password migration script:
```bash
go run migrate_passwords.go
```

#### Session expired errors
Sessions expire after 24 hours. Users need to log in again.

#### CSRF token errors
Clear browser cookies and cache, then try again.
