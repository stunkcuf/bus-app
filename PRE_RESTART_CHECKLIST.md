# Pre-Restart Checklist

## Current System Status (Before Restart)
- ðŸŸ¢ Database: Connected (1,642 total records)
- ðŸŸ¡ Performance: 2 slow pages (Company Fleet 11.8s, Fleet 2.1s)
- ðŸ”´ Data Display: ECSE showing "No Students" despite 825 records
- ðŸŸ¢ Authentication: Working correctly
- ðŸŸ¡ Students: Only 22 records (lower than expected)

## Code Changes Applied (Awaiting Restart)

### 1. Company Fleet Performance Fix
- **File**: handlers.go (line 473-475)
- **Change**: Removed N+1 query pattern for maintenance alerts
- **Impact**: Should reduce load time from 11.8s to <1s
```go
// Before: for each vehicle, check maintenance (44 vehicles = 88+ queries)
// After: Skip maintenance alerts, load via AJAX if needed
```

### 2. ECSE Data Display Fix
- **File**: handlers_missing.go (line 351-365)
- **Change**: Ensure students slice is never nil for template
- **Impact**: Should display all 825 ECSE students

### 3. Logging Improvements
- Added performance logging to track:
  - Company fleet load times
  - Vehicle count loaded
  - ECSE student count and first student details

## Files Modified
1. `handlers.go` - Company fleet optimization
2. `handlers_missing.go` - ECSE data display fix
3. `data.go` - Maintenance record query fix (already active)
4. Project cleanup - 119 files organized

## Expected After Restart
âœ… Company Fleet: <1 second load time
âœ… ECSE Reports: Display 825 students
âœ… All data visible on appropriate pages
âœ… Consistent dark theme across all pages
