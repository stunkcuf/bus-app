# Fleet Management System - Fixes Complete Summary

## Date: 2025-07-30

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Fleet Page - Edit Button
- **Problem**: Edit button showed "coming soon" alert instead of functioning
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `editBusHandler` in `handlers_fleet_bus_edit.go`
  - Created `edit_bus.html` template
  - Updated JavaScript to redirect to `/edit-bus?id=<busID>`
  - Registered handler in main.go

#### 2. Fleet Page - Dropdown Overlap
- **Problem**: Status dropdowns overlapped with buttons in rows below
- **Solution**: Added CSS z-index fixes to ensure dropdowns appear above other elements
- **Files Modified**: `templates/fleet.html`

#### 3. Route Assignment Logic
- **Problem**: System prevented drivers from being assigned to multiple routes
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect UNIQUE constraint on driver column in route_assignments table
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `route_assignments_driver_key` constraint
  - Updated route assignment wizard to show all driver assignments
  - Modified JavaScript to allow and encourage multiple route assignments
  - Added info-style warnings instead of error warnings
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `handlers_wizards.go`
  - `templates/route_assignment_wizard.html`
  - Database constraint removed via `fix_route_constraints.go`

#### 4. Missing Progress Indicator Template
- **Problem**: Template error "no such template 'progress_indicator'"
- **Solution**: Created `templates/progress_indicator.html` with progress bar and step indicators
- **Used By**: Import wizard and route assignment wizard

#### 5. User Management - Edit Button
- **Problem**: GET request to /edit-user returned "Only POST method allowed"
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `editUserHandler` to handle both GET and POST requests
  - Created `edit_user.html` template
  - GET shows edit form, POST updates user data

#### 6. User Management - Delete Button
- **Problem**: Delete button functionality was unclear
- **Solution**: Already working correctly with confirmation dialog system
- **Uses**: `confirmationHelpers.confirmDelete()` from `confirmation_dialog.js`

#### 7. Pending Approvals
- **Problem**: Pending user "barb" not showing in approvals page
- **Solution**: Fixed data structure in `approveUsersHandler` to use PageData format
- **Result**: Pending users now display correctly

#### 8. Monthly Mileage Reports - Blur Issue
- **Problem**: Entire page was blurry due to excessive backdrop-filter blur effects
- **Solution**: Commented out all `backdrop-filter: blur()` CSS rules
- **Files Modified**: `templates/monthly_mileage_reports.html`

### Additional Fixes

#### Admin Login Restoration
- **Issue**: Admin password was changed during testing
- **Solution**: Password restored to original "Headstart1"
- **Credentials**: username: admin, password: Headstart1

- ✅ All 6 critical tests passed
- ✅ Pending users visible (1 user: barb)
