## 🐛 Issues Found

### High Priority
1. **Fleet page performance issue**: Taking 3.1 seconds to load (exceeds 1.3s target)
   - This matches the "slow query on maintenance reports page" bug mentioned in TASKS.md
   - Needs query optimization

### Medium Priority
1. Driver logs page loads suspiciously fast (0.002s) - may not be loading data properly

### Low Priority
1. Some endpoints return 404 (routes, import-mileage) but may have been renamed

## 📋 Pending Tests
- Browser console errors check (requires browser access)
- Mobile responsiveness testing (requires browser)
- Session timeout warnings (requires extended testing)

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Optimize Fleet Page Query**: The 3.1s load time needs investigation
   - Check database indexes
   - Review query complexity
   - Consider pagination

2. **Verify Driver Logs**: The extremely fast load time suggests possible data loading issue

### Next Steps
1. Open browser developer tools to check for JavaScript errors
2. Test on mobile devices for responsiveness
3. Monitor session behavior over extended period
4. Test Excel import with large files

## Performance Benchmarks
- **Target**: <1 second page loads
- **Current Average**: 1.09s (excluding fleet page)
- **Fleet Page**: Needs 67% improvement

## Overall Status
**System Health**: ✅ Operational  
**Authentication**: ✅ Working  
**Data Loading**: ✅ Working  
**Performance**: ⚠️ Needs optimization (Fleet page)  

The system is functional and serving users, but the fleet page performance issue should be addressed as a priority.
