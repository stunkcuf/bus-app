# Data Display Issues Found

## 1. Manager Dashboard - Mock Data Issue ❌
**File:** `handlers.go` (lines 268-287)
**Issue:** The "RecentActivity" section is using hardcoded mock data instead of real activity logs
```go
// Mock recent activity for now
data["RecentActivity"] = []map[string]interface{}{
    {
        "Type":    "success",
        "Icon":    "check-circle",
        "Message": "Bus #101 completed morning route",
        "Time":    "10 minutes ago",
    },
    // ... more mock data
}
```
**TODO:** Line 251 also has `"RecentActivity": nil, // TODO: Implement activity tracking`

## 2. Import Handlers - Mock Data ❌
**File:** `handlers_missing.go`
**Issues:**
- `importAnalyzeHandler` - Returns mock data (TODO comment)
- `importValidateHandler` - Returns mock validation results (TODO comment)
- `importExecuteHandler` - Returns mock results (TODO comment)

## 3. Driver Dashboard ✅
**Status:** Appears to be loading real data correctly
- Gets driver assignments from database
- Loads students for assigned routes
- Maintenance alerts are disabled (commented as "required columns not in database")

## 4. Student Management ✅
**Status:** Appears to be loading real data from the `students` table

## 5. Route Assignments ✅
**Status:** Loading real data from `route_assignments` table with proper joins

## 6. Company Fleet Page ✅
**Status:** Loading data from consolidated `fleet_vehicles` table with fallback to old tables

## 7. Mileage Reports ✅
**Status:** Loading real data from `mileage_reports` and `driver_logs` tables

## 8. ECSE Management ✅
**Status:** Loading real data from `ecse_students` and `ecse_services` tables

## 9. Fleet Page ✅
**Status:** Loading data from consolidated `fleet_vehicles` table

## 10. Report Builder ⚠️
**File:** `report_builder.go` (line 519)
**Issue:** SavedReports is hardcoded as empty array with TODO comment
```go
SavedReports: []ReportBuilder{}, // TODO: Load from database
```

## Summary

### Critical Issues to Fix:
1. **Manager Dashboard Recent Activity** - Replace mock data with real activity tracking
2. **Import Handlers** - Implement actual file analysis, validation, and import logic
3. **Report Builder** - Implement saved reports loading from database

### Working Correctly:
- Driver Dashboard (except maintenance alerts need database columns)
- Fleet Management (buses and vehicles)
- Student Management
- Route Assignments
- ECSE Management
- Mileage Reports
- Company Fleet

### Notes:
- Several handlers have sample data generators (addSampleFleetDataHandler, addSampleECSEDataHandler, etc.) which are intentional for demo purposes
- The consolidated `fleet_vehicles` table is being used correctly with fallbacks to old tables
- Most data loading is working properly through the cache system and database queries
