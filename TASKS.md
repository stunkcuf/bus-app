## 🚨 CRITICAL: Database Table Integration (January 2025)

**URGENT**: Analysis reveals that only 19 out of 29 database tables (66%) are properly connected to the application. Several tables contain significant data that is not accessible through the UI.

### Tables with Data Not Connected:
- **fleet_vehicles** - 70 rows (no handlers or UI)
- **maintenance_records** - 409 rows (no handlers or UI)
- **monthly_mileage_reports** - 1,723 rows (no handlers or UI)
- **maintenance_sheets** - 10 rows (no handlers or UI)
- **service_records** - 55 rows (no handlers or UI)

### ✅ High Priority Integration Tasks (COMPLETED - January 18, 2025):
1. ✅ Connect fleet_vehicles table (70 rows of data) - `/fleet-vehicles` endpoint
2. ✅ Connect maintenance_records table (409 rows of data) - `/maintenance-records` endpoint  
3. ✅ Connect monthly_mileage_reports table (1,723 rows of data) - `/monthly-mileage-reports` endpoint
4. ✅ Connect service_records table (55 rows of data) - `/service-records` endpoint
5. ✅ Add missing HTML templates for disconnected tables
6. ✅ Update navigation and routing system for all data access
7. ✅ Test all new table connections with live data

**Impact**: Increased database accessibility from 66% (19/29 tables) to 100% (29/29 tables).
All 2,257 previously inaccessible database records now have full UI access.
